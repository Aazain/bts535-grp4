Describe the problem:

Bikes are an interesting mode of transportation. Like cars, they all do the same thing, transport you. However there are  
so many different options, with many different purposes/use cases. From your typical pedal bike, to electric assistance and full electric bikes, the 
 options are endless. Some people may get a bike for a calm ride down the creek  
on the weekend, some may use a bike to get to work, and some may even use a bike for their work like uber deliveries in  
busy downtown Toronto. The problem is many customers don't know much about bikes, while most bike shops are built around  
enthusiasts. This makes the accessibility of the market very small, outside of cheap, overpriced bikes offered at stores like Walmart.  
The goal for our bike shop is to cater to a beginner AND enthusiast market, making it easy for customers to choose the right bike for them,  
while also offering any bikes/parts that biking veterans may need.  

Propose a solution:

To make it easier and more accessible for everyone to find the right bike, we propose a user-friendly website, that will contain informative content on bike categories and their purposes, a bike finder tool, a blog with cycling tips for the beginners and experts, and information about our services. 
We will also highlight our store location, contact information, and social media links to encourage customer engagement.
Our website will also offer a wide range of bikes, parts, and accessories for both beginners and enthusiasts, including options for custom orders. 
Additionally, to help users make informed choices based on other customers' experiences, our website will offer a customer reviews and ratings section.
This comprehensive approach will make our bike shop a go-to destination for cyclists and those who wants to become one.


Technologies Required:

The front end of the website will be developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (for certain dynamic features). Content will be managed through WordPress in order to provide an accessible blogging platform for cycling tips & articles.
The website will have payment processing through Square and will use a MySQL database to manage our inventory.
Google Maps will also be integrated into the website to aid in displaying store locations and local bike routes.
The website will incorporate customer reviews, social media integration, and a bike finder tool to enhance user engagement.
