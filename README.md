Describe the problem:

Bikes are an interesting mode of transportation. Like cars, they all do the same thing, transport you. However there are  
so many different options, with many different purposes/use cases. From your typical pedal bike, to electric assistance and full electric bikes, the 
 options are endless. Some people may get a bike for a calm ride down the creek  
on the weekend, some may use a bike to get to work, and some may even use a bike for their work like uber deliveries in  
busy downtown Toronto. The problem is many customers don't know much about bikes, while most bike shops are built around  
enthusiasts. This makes the accessibility of the market very small, outside of cheap, overpriced bikes offered at stores like Walmart.  
The goal for our bike shop is to cater to a beginner AND enthusiast market, making it easy for customers to choose the right bike for them,  
while also offering any bikes/parts that biking veterans may need.  

Propose a solution:

To make it easier and more accessible for everyone to find the right bike, we propose a user-friendly website that will contain informative content on bike categories and their purposes, a bike finder tool, a blog with cycling tips for beginners and experts, and information about our services.
We will also highlight our store location, contact information, and social media links to encourage customer engagement.
Our website will also offer a wide range of bikes, parts, and accessories for both beginners and enthusiasts, including options for custom orders.
Additionally, to help users make informed choices based on other customers' experiences, our website will offer a customer reviews and ratings section.
To further support customer inquiries, the website will feature live chat support, allowing users to ask questions and get real-time assistance regarding products, services, and sizing advice.
This comprehensive approach will make our bike shop a go-to destination for cyclists and those who want to become one.


Technologies Required:

The website's front end will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience. 
For managing the blog content, we will integrate WordPress to provide an easy platform for updating cycling tips and articles.
The back end will use Node.js and Express.js for handling server-side operations. MySQL will manage product inventory, customer reviews, and order information.

Square will handle secure payment processing for online purchases. Google Maps API will be used to display store locations and local bike routes, enhancing customer convenience. The website will be hosted on a Linux-based VPS (Virtual Private Server) for flexibility and control over hosting.
