Describe the problem:

Bikes are an interesting mode of transportation. Like cars, they all do the same thing, transport you. However there are  
so many different options, with many different purposes/use cases. From your typical pedal bike, to electric assistance and full electric bikes, the options are endless. Some people may get a bike for a calm ride down the creek  
on the weekend, some may use a bike to get to work, and some may even use a bike for their work like uber deliveries in  
busy downtown Toronto. The problem is many customers don't know much about bikes, while most bike shops are built around  
enthusiasts. This makes the accessibility of the market very small, outside of cheap, overpriced bikes offered at stores like Walmart.  
The goal for our bike shop is to cater to a beginner AND enthusiast market, making it easy for customers to choose the right bike for them,  
while also offering any bikes/parts that biking veterans may need.
