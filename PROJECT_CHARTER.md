#### 7.1 Risks
1. **Hosting and Domain Issues**: Problems with website hosting or domain registration could affect the availability of the website, making it inaccessible to customers if the hosting provider experiences downtime.
2. **Service Provider Price Hikes**: Unexpected price increases in contracted services such as hosting, domain registration, or payment gateways (e.g., Square) could negatively impact the projectâ€™s budget and timeline.
3. **Unintended Changes by Admin**: Administrators or other team members with access to the system could inadvertently make changes that cause the website to malfunction or become inaccessible.
4. **Usability Issues for Customers**: Some customers, particularly those unfamiliar with online shopping, may find it difficult to navigate the new system, leading to potential frustration and loss of sales.

#### 7.3 Assumptions
1. The project team will be proficient in all the technologies required to create and maintain the website, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and server management.
2. The contracted services for hosting and domain registration will be extremely reliable, with a service uptime of more than 99.9%, ensuring the website remains accessible.
3. Customers will find value in the features offered, such as the bike finder tool, product reviews, and live chat support, encouraging regular use of the platform.

#### 7.4 Constraints
1. **Data Privacy**: The website will not store or display any sensitive personal information beyond customer names and emails, adhering to privacy and security regulations.
2. **Budget Limitations**: The project must operate within a fixed budget, meaning the team will need to carefully prioritize features and services that offer the most value for the website.
3. **Technology Stack**: The project will use a fixed technology stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, Square for payment processing) and cannot deviate from these core technologies.

#### 7.5 Quality Assurance

   - **Unit Testing**: Individual components of the website will be tested to ensure they work as expected.

   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End users (customers) will test the website to ensure that it meets their needs and is easy to navigate.
2. **Security Testing**: The website will undergo regular security checks, particularly for sensitive transactions such as those handled by the Square payment gateway.
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The website will be tested across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent behavior and performance on different platforms.
4. **Performance Testing**: The website will be optimized for fast load times and responsiveness on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth customer experience.
