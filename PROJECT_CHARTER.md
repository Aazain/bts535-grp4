# Bike Shop Website

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to create a dynamic and user-friendly website for a bike shop. The website will allow customers to browse products by category, track orders, chat with customer support, and access cycling tips. It will also include a product review section for experienced cyclists and a bike finder tool for beginners.
